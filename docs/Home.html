<h1>What's JSONSource?</h1>
<p>JSONSource is a custom source component developed for Microsoft Integration Services, compatible with MS SQL Server 2012/2014/<strong>2016</strong>. The goal of this component is to allow the developer to integrate JSON datasources into his ETL projects.
<br>
Among the major&nbsp;features of JSONSource, there&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read&nbsp;JSON Data directly from a webservice via HTTP GET/POST/PUT/DELETE </li><li>Read JSON Data from a URL coded into a project variable or hard coded </li><li>Read JSON Data from file or from a file pointed by a project variable or hard coded
</li><li>Given a mapping table, JSONSource maps every attribute of the json objects into the corresponding output field of the given table.
</li><li>Supports complex jsonpath queries </li><li>Supports HTTP GET/POST parameters via&nbsp;input lines/variables/hard-coding </li><li>Login into webservice are now possible using a combination of multiple components
</li></ul>

<h2>Flexible source</h2>
<p>JSONSource supports different kinds of data sources:&nbsp;it can be either used for parsing a text file on the disk or directly download the json file, by performing. Beside, the developer can specify a variable holding the HTTP URL or the physical disk
 path to the json data.</p>
<p>When dealing with webservices or standard http pages, json source is capable of executing the most common HTTP requests type, such as GET/POST/PUT/DELETE.&nbsp;Moreover HTTP requests parameters are supported, so the developer can perform complex actions
 with a webservice. Login via access tokes are then supported, simply perform a login request and save the token into a variable, then perform next queries using&nbsp;that variable as query parameter!</p>
<h2>Easy Mapping and advanced json parsing</h2>
<p>The mapping table is a grid that defines which object fields to take into account and how to interpret them: for each object-field the developer has to specify an output column name and an output data type. Although this&nbsp;component supports both array
 of objects and simple objects, some more complex operation is possible thanks to the magic of JsonPath. Indeed, the developer can specify very complex query to get almost any combination of data out of the datasource!</p>
<h2>Easy Instalation</h2>
<p>To install this component the developer can easily use the custom installer, which will automatically detect every compatible MSSQL installation and will ask where to install the feature. However, the stand-alone dll is also given, for expert users.</p>
<h2>Do you have any idea?</h2>
<p>I'm continuously listening to users feedbacks. The following are some points I want to implement in future releases of the software. Due to small time I have to dedicate to this project I cannot state precisely when those features will be implemented. However,
 if you have any other idea or if you want to tell which feature would be better to implement first, feel free to vote it on the discussion section.</p>
